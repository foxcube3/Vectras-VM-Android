Welcome to Vectras VM! A virtual machine app for Android based on QEMU that let you emulate various OS including: Windows, MacOS, Linux and Android.

We are, currently, working so hard on rebasing the project, thus, we made the project closed source since the rebased project (v2.8) will be almost completely diffrent from the previous version. Don't worry, we will make the project open source again when the rebase finishs :)

# TODO
- [x] XSDL X11
- [ ] Machine system (like VMWARE)
- [ ] PPC, arch64, i386
